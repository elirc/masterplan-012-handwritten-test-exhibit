# Six junior practice stories

[Debugging lab](04-DEBUGGING-LAB.md) · [Hints — use after an attempt](06-HINTS-AND-ANSWERS.md)

These are new exercises beyond the finished reference. No story is marked complete for you. Start a branch such as practice/story-01 and write acceptance examples before editing. Each plan leaves the actual code, wording and one design choice to you.

## Story 01: Add result totals

**Feature boundary:** Derive passed and failed counts from completed result rows rather than incrementing counters in multiple places.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `runCases` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Totals match rows including an empty suite and a suite with two failures.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

**Acceptance evidence:** Totals match rows including an empty suite and a suite with two failures.

**Left for you:** exact fixture values, names, wording, the implementation and the tradeoff decision. Do not open the hints until you have an example and a first attempt.

**Stretch only after completion:** add one adversarial example that a plausible but incorrect solution would fail. Explain why that example is more informative than adding three ordinary examples.

## Story 02: Add a descriptive assertion label

**Feature boundary:** Supply a domain-specific message when the shipping boundary fails.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `runCases` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: The message names the quantity and still includes actual and expected values.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

**Left for you:** exact fixture values, names, wording, the implementation and the tradeoff decision. Do not open the hints until you have an example and a first attempt.

**Stretch only after completion:** add one adversarial example that a plausible but incorrect solution would fail. Explain why that example is more informative than adding three ordinary examples.

## Story 03: Practice rejecting a boundary mutant

**Feature boundary:** Write a scratch candidate using greater-than three instead of greater-than-or-equal three.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `runCases` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Your new test fails for that candidate at exactly three and passes for the reference.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.

**Stretch only after completion:** add one adversarial example that a plausible but incorrect solution would fail. Explain why that example is more informative than adding three ordinary examples.

## Story 04: Describe identity comparison

**Feature boundary:** Add a separate example that compares two distinct objects and explains the scalar-only contract.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `runCases` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: The lesson does not claim to provide deep equality or change the scalar tests silently.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

**Stretch only after completion:** add one adversarial example that a plausible but incorrect solution would fail. Explain why that example is more informative than adding three ordinary examples.

## Story 05: Show only failed rows

**Feature boundary:** Add a UI filter after collecting all results; retain the full result array.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `runCases` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Filtering changes display, not execution or counts; intentional failure remains visible.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.

## Story 06: Detect a vacuous test in review

**Feature boundary:** Write two short candidate tests, one meaningful and one fixture-only, with a reviewer checklist.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `runCases` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: The explanation identifies which product mutation each test would detect, including none for the weak test.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.

## Additional planning checkpoints for stories 01–06

[Nine more stories, 07–15](11-NINE-MORE-STORIES.md) · [Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md)

Keep the original plans above. The following checkpoints add implementation and review depth without completing the exercise for you.

### Story 01 planning clinic: Add result totals

**Before editing:** restate the boundary in your own words: Derive passed and failed counts from completed result rows rather than incrementing counters in multiple places. Identify the part of `public/core.js` or `public/app.js` that owns it. If your proposed design changes another owner, explain the dependency instead of opening every file for a broad rewrite.

**Acceptance matrix:** write ordinary, boundary and repeat/recovery rows that establish “Totals match rows including an empty suite and a suite with two failures.” Include exact starting data or content and the expected retained information. Calculate expected values or inspect meaningful source order independently of the proposed implementation.

**First implementation slice:** make only enough of the change to demonstrate one acceptance row. Inspect the diff and predict the next row before running it. If your first slice is mostly setup or abstraction with no observable result, consider a smaller direct route.

**Review challenge:** sketch a plausible wrong solution that would pass a casual demonstration. Choose a counterexample that exposes its specific weakness. Ask an assistant to critique that example rather than immediately asking it to finish the entire feature.

**Evidence and explanation:** use npm test, plus the relevant real interaction or CLI observation. Record the actual observation and the limit of the check. Finish by naming a design decision you made yourself and explaining why the neighboring original behavior still holds.

### Story 02 planning clinic: Add a descriptive assertion label
