# M012: architecture decision laboratory

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

Architecture at this scale means assigning responsibilities and avoiding unnecessary synchronization. You do not need a distributed system diagram to make a consequential design choice. A small function boundary, a stable identifier or one CSS owner can determine whether a later change stays understandable.

## Decision review 1: Make the assertion state the difference

**Reference rationale:** The helper includes expected and received values in its error. That makes an ordinary wrong-value result visible without using a debugger first. Object.is deliberately gives identity semantics for objects; only scalar teaching examples are promised. Extending equality requires a new contract, not an assumption that printed JSON is a correct comparator.

**Question to resolve:** What does this helper do with two distinct objects containing the same properties?

### Write competing proposals

Proposal A is the reference approach. Proposal B must be a plausible alternative, not an obviously broken straw man. Describe what each stores, what each derives, which boundary each validates and where visible feedback occurs. For a static page, describe source order, container/child ownership and content behavior instead of inventing application state.

### Use the same acceptance examples

Run both proposals against the same ordinary case, boundary and future-change scenario. If they produce different behavior, decide whether the difference is permitted by the contract. If both satisfy the contract, compare the number of facts a maintainer must keep synchronized and the amount of unrelated work needed for the next feature.

| Criterion | Reference proposal | Alternative proposal | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meets current user contract | Fill in | Fill in | One discriminating example |
| Owns each fact in one place | Fill in | Fill in | Source or state diagram |
| Handles failure or missing input | Fill in | Fill in | Error/recovery sequence |
| Supports the next small story | Fill in | Fill in | Proposed bounded diff |

### Record the decision with a reversal condition

Write: “I choose A/B because this concrete example shows this cost. I would revisit the choice if this specific requirement appeared.” A reversal condition prevents the decision from becoming a slogan. Do not use a hypothetical million-user future to justify complexity that teaches nothing about the present example.

**Source anchor:** `public/core.js` and `public/app.js`. Inspect the actual dependency direction; a diagram that names layers but cannot identify a call or data flow is incomplete.

## Decision review 2: Catch per case

**Reference rationale:** A try/catch inside map isolates cases. Putting one catch outside the complete loop would stop after the first failure and hide later evidence. The runner also converts non-Error throws into readable detail because JavaScript can throw arbitrary values.

**Question to resolve:** How would you prove the case after a failure really ran?

## Decision review 3: Demonstrate a weak green test

**Reference rationale:** One case compares a fixture with itself. It intentionally receives PASS from the assertion machinery, while the UI explains its limitation. The independent Node suite supplies a wrong constant candidate to show that a meaningful boundary assertion rejects it. The distinction is between a working runner and a test that asks a useful question.

**Question to resolve:** Which changed implementation would your proposed assertion detect?

## Avoid accidental scope expansion

A new abstraction should answer a problem you can name in the current code or selected story. If the main benefit is that it looks more professional, ask what specific change becomes easier and what new concepts a junior now has to learn. Keep the reference small enough to trace.

## Transfer the review habit

Would your test still pass if the implementation always returned the same answer?

Use that question to compare this project with its paired curriculum repository. Cite the actual source or guide you inspected; do not claim the other repository uses a pattern merely because its name sounds related. Your comparison may conclude that the shared learning concept appears in a different implementation.
